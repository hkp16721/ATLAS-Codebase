Quick sort is again divide and conquer mechanism based sorting algorithm.
In this, we select 1 element as pivot meaning first element, last element or middle element can be pivot,
array will be divided to left and right sort keeping pivot as fix
Function will call recursively

Algo
---------
Select Pivot
Elements < Pivot go to Left
Elements > Pivot go to Right
Place the pivot in its correct position.
Recursively apply the same steps to the left and right sub-arrays.
The array is sorted when all recursive calls are complete.

Pseudocode
-------------
function quickSort(array, low, high)
    if low < high then
        pivotIndex = partition(array, low, high)
        quickSort(array, low, pivotIndex - 1)
        quickSort(array, pivotIndex + 1, high)

function partition(array, low, high)
    pivot = array[high]
    i = low - 1
    for j from low to high - 1 do
        if array[j] < pivot then
            i = i + 1
            swap array[i] with array[j]
    swap array[i + 1] with array[high]
    return i + 1
