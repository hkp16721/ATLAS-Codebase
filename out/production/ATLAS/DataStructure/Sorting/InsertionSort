Insertion Sort
------------------
 Insertion sort is a simple and intuitive sorting algorithm that builds a sorted array (or list) one element at a time.

 Algo
 ------------------
 1. Check 2nd element, as first always considered sorted
 2. Compare new element with previously sorted elements
 3. Identify and insert at correct position by shifting all larger to right
 4. Repeat till array sorted
 5. End

 Pseudo Code
 --------------------
 function insertionSort(array x){
    for i from i=1 till length-1:
        next = x[i]
        j=i-1
        while j>=0 and x[j]>next:
           x[j+1]=x[j]
           j=j-1
        x[j+1]=next;
 }
